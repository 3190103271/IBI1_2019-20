South Korea, Kenya, and Colombia are three countries in diï¬€erent parts of the world, but with similar populations. Plot the total number of COVID cases over time in all three.

60-80

It is in my expectation. Because of the different virus outbreak dates, the total cases and the trands in these three countries differ a lot.
