I programmed my SIR model without the help of the guide and the sample file.
Besides, in my first program, I used class definition which I had never used before. It helped me understand how to define and use a custom class.
There were also three notable points in spatial SIR model. First, 0.3 was too big for beta, so I reduced it. Secondly, I changed the color of the images in the guide. Finally, I added some legends to figures.
However, I only managed to draw curves with different shades without drawing curves in gradients like the vaccination figure in practical guide.
